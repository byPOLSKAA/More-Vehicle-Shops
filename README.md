# About esx_import:
Secondary Vehicleshop for ESX

I did NOT create the Code. I only edited the esx_vehicleshop code to create this new shop. This code unlike most other versions out there do NOT interfere with the Original esx_vehicleshop.

# Requirements:
* Auto mode (everyone can buy vehicles from the dealer)
  * ESX
  
* Optional:
  * [esx_drp_garage](https://github.com/lilfuchs/esx_drp_garage)

# Download & Installation:
1) Download the .zip.
2) Extract the .zip or Open the .zip.
3) Import `esx_import.sql` in your database
4) Place `esx_import` in your ESX Directory
5) Add `start esx_import` to your server.cfg
6) Restart your server and have fun!
